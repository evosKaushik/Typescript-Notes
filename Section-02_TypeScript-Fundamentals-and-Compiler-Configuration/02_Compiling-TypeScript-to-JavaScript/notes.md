# 📘 Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript

## 🚀 Installing TypeScript Compiler

TypeScript is available as an npm package.

Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Check installation:

```bash
tsc -v
```

`tsc` stands for **TypeScript Compiler**.

---

# 🔨 TypeScript TSC Commands

## Check Version

```bash
tsc -v
```

## Compile a File

```bash
tsc filepath.ts
```

Compiles the TypeScript file into JavaScript.

Output:

```bash
filepath.js
```

---

## Target JavaScript Version

### ES6+

Modern syntax is preserved:

```js
let age = 20;
const name = "Kaushik";
```

### Below ES6 (ES5, ES3)

Older syntax is generated:

```js
var age = 20;
var name = "Kaushik";
```

-> Older syntax has better compatibility with old browsers.

---

## Useful Commands

### Type Check Only

```bash
tsc --noEmit
```

-> Checks for errors.
-> No `.js` file is generated.

### Don't Generate JS if Errors Exist

```bash
tsc --noEmitOnError
```

-> If errors exist, no JavaScript file is created.

---

# ⚙️ tsconfig.json

Create a configuration file:

```bash
tsc --init
```

When a `tsconfig.json` exists:

-> TypeScript uses the settings inside it.
-> VS Code also uses those settings for the project.

Compile all TypeScript files:

```bash
tsc
```

Watch for file changes:

```bash
tsc --watch
```

or

```bash
tsc -w
```

---

# ❌ Declaration Error

When no `tsconfig.json` exists and files are not modules (no import/export), TypeScript treats all files as part of the same global scope.

Example:

file1.ts

```ts
let age = 20;
```

file2.ts

```ts
let age = 30;
```

Error:

```text
Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'age'
```

---

# ✅ How to Fix

## Method 1

Create a `tsconfig.json`.

This enables module-based configuration and proper file scoping.

---

## Method 2

Add:

```ts
export {};
```

This makes the file a module and creates its own scope.

---

# ⚔️ Compiler vs Transpiler

## Compiler

A compiler converts source code into another form.

Traditionally:

```text
High-Level Language
        ↓
Machine Code
```

Compilation is not a single process.

It contains multiple phases such as:

```text
Lexing
↓
Parsing
↓
Type Checking
↓
Transformations
↓
Output Generation
```

---

## Transpiler

A transpiler converts one high-level language into another high-level language.

Example:

```text
Modern JavaScript
        ↓
       Babel
        ↓
Older JavaScript
```

Example:

```js
const age = 20;
```

↓

```js
var age = 20;
```

---

## TSC: Compiler or Transpiler?

TypeScript's `tsc` is a **compiler**.

Fun Fact:

👉 Transpilation is just one phase of the TypeScript compilation process.

# 🔬 How TypeScript Compiles to JavaScript

Input:

```ts
const age: number = 20;
```

Compilation Flow:

```text
index.ts
   ↓
Lexing (Tokenizer)
   ↓
Parsing
   ↓
AST Creation
   ↓
Type Checking
   ↓
Transformations
   ↓
TypeScript → JavaScript
```

---

## 1️⃣ Lexing (Tokenizer)

Breaks source code into tokens.

Example:

```ts
const age: number = 20;
```

Tokens:

```text
const
age
:
number
=
20
;
```

---

## 2️⃣ Parsing

Provides structure to the tokens using an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

AST is a tree representation of code.

Example:

```ts
const age: number = 20;
```

AST:

```text
VariableDeclaration
├── Name: age
├── Type: number
└── Value: 20
```

### Tree Visualization

```text
const age: number = 20;
        ↓
       AST

 VariableDeclaration
      /      \
    age       20
```

---

## 3️⃣ Type Checking

Checks whether the types are valid.

Example:

```ts
let age: number = "hello";
```

Error:

```text
Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

---

## 4️⃣ Transformations

Transforms TypeScript into JavaScript.

This is where the transpilation phase happens.

Example:

```ts
const age: number = 20;
```

Transforms to:

```js
const age = 20;
```

---

# 📝 Notes

✅ Browsers understand JavaScript, not TypeScript.

✅ TypeScript must be compiled before running in a browser.

✅ `tsc` is a compiler.

✅ Transpilation is one phase of compilation.

✅ Type annotations are removed during transformation.

### One-Line Summary

> TypeScript first checks your code for errors and then converts it into plain JavaScript.
